It is still technically summer as far as CD is concerned which means it is time for one more (very dumb) project.

I have asked 5 LLMs to strategize, design and program robots for Crescendo. The purpose of this test is to asses weather or not they were trained on relevant data for FRC use. Obviously no one should actually be doing this or be exempt from using their own squishy brains to solve problems, but these are real tools that get used and perhaps it is an opportunity to teach ethical use. Note that this usecase is not realistically practical anyway as models take time to train.

[details="Anyway, all 5 LLMs were asked the same 3 questions in succession:"]
1. You have been tasked with designing a robot for the 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition game: Crescendo. To begin, explain the strategy that you will approach the game with, indicating specific objectives to accomplish. It is not possible to do everything, therefore, aim for a maximum of 3 objectives. Be specific about which tasks within the game you intend to accomplish.
2. Next, design the subsystems that will be needed to accomplish the tasks that you have selected. Describe the general mechanical design of these systems and explain your choice of actuator (if present) for each one.
3. Finally, write the necessary Java code to operate the subsystems you have described previously using the WPILib framework. You may use additional vendor libraries as needed.
[/details]

The five models tested are GPT-4, Sonnet 3.5, Llama 3.1, Flash 1.5 and Mistral Large.

### Microsoft/OpenAI Copilot (GPT-4)
1. Copilot comes up with some decent steps to take, but is unable to provide specifics as to what its exact game strategy is.
2. It clearly has no information on the game. Did manage to describe the most generic FRC robot though. Not sure where it got chassis height adjustment.
3. The use of PWMSparkMax is highly indicative that Copilot has been trained on WPILib Docs. It made a *start* on swerve modules, but does not have a full swerve subsystem. Command declarations were not made in the subsystems. Some parts are just not done.

### Anthropic Claude (3.5 Sonnet)
1. Claude came up with detailed strategy and reasoning for it. This is very specific, was it trained on CD at all? Not sure the assessment on complexity of Amp vs Speaker is correct.
2. Did not come up with under bumper intake. Is listing real motors in reasonable uses. The pneumatic tyres are unusual, not sure where it got that from. It listed control system components, but does not seem to know that Limelight is a coprocessor or that RPis are not optimal in that role.
3. Starts with RobotContainer first. Using Rev API directly. Did create commands. Not sure about how an upper limit switch on the climber works, but it could be hall effect. Claude correctly inverted the limit switch value.

[details="output"]
Let me outline a focused strategy for the 2024 FRC Crescendo game. I'll analyze the game elements and propose specific objectives that balance scoring potential with mechanical complexity.

Strategic Objectives:

1. Amp Scoring Specialist - Floor Note Pickup
- Focus on rapid collection of notes from the floor using a low, wide intake system
- Consistently deliver notes to the amp for 2 points each
- This is a relatively lower-difficulty scoring method compared to speaker shots
- Position robot primarily in the amp side of the field for quick scoring cycles
- Target scoring 5-6 notes per match through the amp (10-12 points)

2. Stage Climbing - Main Endgame Focus
- Design a robust climbing mechanism to reach the chain level on the stage
- Aim to consistently score 4 points for a basic hang
- The climbing mechanism should be simple and reliable rather than trying for more complex arrangements
- Begin positioning for the climb with 20-30 seconds remaining in the match

3. Note Starting Position Automation
- Develop reliable autonomous routines to score preloaded notes
- Focus on collecting and scoring 1-2 additional notes during auto
- Target 6-8 points during autonomous (2 notes scored + mobility)
- This provides a strong early lead while being mechanically achievable

Notably, this strategy intentionally avoids:
- Speaker scoring (which requires more complex shooting mechanisms)
- Trap scoring (which requires precise endgame manipulation)
- Harmony climbing (which adds significant mechanical complexity)

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these objectives or explain why certain game elements were excluded from the strategy?
***
I'll break down each major subsystem needed for our strategic objectives:

1. Floor Intake System
- Wide, roller-based intake (~24" wide) using compliant wheels or surgical tubing
- Single 775pro motor or NEO 550 driving the main roller
- Polycarbonate side guides to help funnel notes into the intake
- Spring-loaded hinged mounting to absorb impact when collecting notes
- Uses pneumatic actuator to deploy/retract the intake to stay within frame perimeter
Rationale: A wide intake increases collection reliability, while the compliant wheels provide good grip on notes. The pneumatic deployment allows for quick actuation and mechanical simplicity.

2. Note Transport/Conveyor
- Vertical conveyor system using timing belts with note-gripping cleats
- Driven by single NEO motor with reduction (likely 5:1 or 7:1)
- Polycarbonate guide channels to maintain note orientation
- Proximity sensor at top to detect successful note transport
Rationale: Timing belts with cleats provide positive control of the note during transport. The NEO offers good speed control and enough torque through reduction.

3. Amp Delivery System
- Fixed angle ejection point positioned for amp height
- Powered roller (NEO 550) to provide consistent ejection speed
- Short guide rails to maintain note orientation during ejection
Rationale: Since the amp height is fixed, we can optimize a single release point rather than building a complex adjustable mechanism.

4. Climbing Mechanism
- Two-stage telescoping arm system using 80/20 aluminum extrusion
- Primary extension driven by dual NEO motors with chain/cable drive
- Self-locking worm gear reduction (~70:1) to maintain position when powered off
- Hook end effector designed specifically for chain engagement
- Limit switches to prevent over-extension
Rationale: The telescoping design provides necessary reach while staying compact. Worm gear reduction prevents back-driving when hanging, and dual motors provide redundancy.

5. Drive Train
- 6-wheel tank drive with center drop
- Four NEO motors (two per side)
- 6" pneumatic wheels for better traction and bump traversal
- ~8:1 overall reduction for balance of speed and control
- High-strength steel chassis frame tubes (2"x1")
Rationale: Tank drive offers good pushing power and simplicity. Center drop helps with stability and turning. Pneumatic wheels help absorb shock when collecting notes or traversing field elements.

Additional Control Elements:
- Raspberry Pi coprocessor for vision processing
- Limelight camera for note detection and alignment
- Multiple beam break sensors for note tracking through system
- REV PDH for power distribution
- Pneumatics Hub for intake actuation

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these subsystems or discuss specific component choices in more detail?

### Meta Meta AI (Llama 3.1
1. Llama seems to go from the perspective that it is part of the team. It clearly does not have any specific information on the game. Guessing Ball is likely to be correct statistically, though. Have no idea what node engagement and rotation means.
2. It did come up with real mechanisms, for a ball. Specified actual relevant shooter and intake. The drivetrain is tank and has four wheels. It might be mixing NODES and CONTROL PANEL. The motors are real, but the use of miniCIM and Falcon for light tasks exclusively is strange. roboRIO mentioned.
3. RobotContainer is first. Subsystems do not extend SubsystemBase and have control bindings inside. There are no commands. VictorSPX was chosen which would contradict the NEO and Falcon options.

[details="output"]

### Google Gemini (1.5 Flash)
1. Gemini named its strategy; this should become and actual requirement when talking to judges. A definite focus on the amp although the active defence seems illegal in this case. Called it maximizing cycle time, but got the details right for minimization.
2. Shooting into the amp, with an adjustable hood. It seems to have conflated intake with human player collection. It gave the TLA "HPS" to Human Player Station - this is not actually used as far as I am aware. The motors suggested are the "CIMcoder" and the NE553 which as far as I can tell is a [55kW AC motor](https://industrialmatrix.com/motor/generalelectric-n553). *All* the drive systems are suggested. 4-6 NE20 motors are suggested for each swerve module. I could not find and NE20 motor, so we will assume that it means [this jet engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawajima_Ne-20)
3. All the code is done timed and no attempt was made to create RobotContainer. The blocking arm here has no sensors and is going to spin. Gemini put data on the dashboard.

[details="output"]

    * Steering: Implement a robust steering system with encoders for precise control and odometry.
    * Actuator Choice:

  * Drivetrain: Four or six high-torque brushless motors (e.g., NE20) for each wheel.

Note:

* This is a high-level design. Detailed engineering drawings, calculations, and prototyping will be crucial for refining the design and optimizing performance.
* Consider using CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360) to create 3D models of the subsystems.
* Thoroughly test each subsystem individually and as part of the complete robot to identify and address any issues.

This design provides a solid foundation for the "Amplified Defense" strategy. By focusing on these key subsystems and iteratively improving their performance, the robot can effectively score on the Amp, disrupt the opponent, and maximize its contribution to the alliance's success.

### Mistral AI Le Chat (Mistral Large)
1. Mistral correctly identifies notes, but not the climbing. It seems to have vauge specific information on the game, but was likely trained on at least some general FRC information. It choses shooting. It specifies a blocking arm.
2. Design details are reasonable, if somewhat vauge. Tank drive chosen. Brushless motors are specified for most things. It is not aware that stepper motors are illegal. Having a low profile is part of the design.
3. Most motors were said to be brushless, but it is using VictorSPs. The DigitalInput is correctly inverted. The climber lacks any sensors. The drivetrain has two Sparks. Interesting that Mistral included tank controls. No RobotContainer, we are doing this timed. It calls CommandScheduler despite not having commands.

[details="output"]
